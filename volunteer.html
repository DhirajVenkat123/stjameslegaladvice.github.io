          <h3>Professional legal advisers needed</h3>
          <p>
            St&nbsp;James Legal Advice Centre (SJLAC) has been providing free legal
            advice in Haringey (Muswell Hill, Colney Hatch and Wood Green) for
            over twenty years. During that time our clinics have helped
            thousands of people with their justice problems – housing, consumer
            rights, benefits claims, family issues and employment rights. Legal
            aid is now rarely available for these types of issues, so SJLAC’s
            work is vital in helping to address this “justice gap”.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are always looking for more legal advisers for our Tuesday
            morning, Wednesday afternoon and Saturday morning clinics. We’re
            looking for legal professionals (barristers or solicitors, possibly
            retired or on a career break) who could give half a day a fortnight
            or once a month to provide advice.
          </p>
          <p>
            No prior experience in the areas of law we address is necessary or
            expected. Current advisers had no experience in these areas before
            they started volunteering. We provide training, support and
            oversight to ensure that volunteer legal advisers are confident
            before they start giving advice on their own. Of course, if you do
            have expertise in relevant areas of law that would be very welcome.
            You’ll be part of a great team, including a wonderful group of law
            students from Middlesex University and other training organisations
            who provide reception, triage and research backup at the clinics.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have legal expertise and some time, please consider
            volunteering with us. Contact
            <a href="mailto:manager@stjameslegaladvice.org">Ann Jenkins</a>
            at <em>manager@stjameslegaladvice.org</em> if you might be interested.
            She will set up a taster session for you at one of our clinics.
