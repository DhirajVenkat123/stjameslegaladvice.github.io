              <p>
                St&nbsp;James Legal Advice Centre (SJLAC) has been providing free legal advice in Haringey
                (Muswell Hill, Colney Hatch and Wood Green) for over twenty years. During that time our clinics
                have helped thousands of people with their justice problems – housing, consumer rights, benefits
                claims, family issues and employment rights. Legal aid is now rarely available for these types of
                issues, so SJLAC’s work is vital in helping to address this “justice gap”.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are always looking for more legal advisers for our Tuesday morning, Wednesday afternoon and
                Saturday morning clinics. We’re looking for legal professionals (barristers or solicitors, possibly
                retired or on a career break) who could give half a day a fortnight or once a month to provide advice.
              </p>
              <p>
                No prior experience in the areas of law we address is necessary or expected. Current advisers had no
                experience in these areas before they started volunteering. We provide training, support and oversight
                to ensure that volunteer legal advisers are confident before they start giving advice on their own.
                If you do have expertise in relevant areas of law that would be very welcome. You’ll be part of a great
                team, including a wonderful group of law students from Middlesex University and other training organisations
                who provide reception, triage and research backup at the clinics.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have legal expertise and some time, please consider volunteering with us.

                <em>manager@stjameslegaladvice.org</em> to arrange a taster session.
